\nimport { Card, Cards, Info } from 'mintlify';\n\n# Detailed Tokenomics Model\n\nHubzz utilizes an innovative tri-token system (`$HBX`, `$HBZ`, `$HBC`) designed to align incentives, reward contributions, and ensure economic stability while paving the way for progressive decentralization. For the foundational principles, see the [Economy Overview](./index).\n\n<Info>\n  **Why Three Tokens?**\n  The system is designed for balance:\n  *   **$HBX** drives user engagement and reputation without direct monetary value.\n  *   **$HBZ** incentivizes essential infrastructure and controlled expansion.\n  *   **$HBC** provides a stable, predictable currency for all transactions, insulating the economy from volatility.\n  This separation allows each token to fulfill its specific role effectively.\n</Info>\n\n## The Hubzz Tokens\n\n<Cards cols={3}>\n  <Card title="$HBX (Experience Token)">\n    *   **Purpose**: Reputation & Activity Metric (like a gamified score).\n    *   **Transferable?**: No (bound to your wallet).\n    *   **Supply**: Infinite (generated by activity, but revocable by Hubzz if needed).\n    *   **How to Earn**: Engage with the platform via quests, event participation, community contributions.\n    *   **Key Uses**: \n        *   Future on-chain transaction gas (making actions cheaper).\n        *   Powering a reputation system (reviews, upvotes).\n        *   Logging activity that can qualify for `$HBZ` rewards.\n    *   **Important**: Can be revoked to prevent botting or abuse.\n  </Card>\n  <Card title="$HBZ (Node Reward Token)">\n    *   **Purpose**: Incentivize infrastructure support & ecosystem expansion.\n    *   **Transferable?**: Yes (can be traded/sold).\n    *   **Supply**: 100 Million Fixed Supply (emissions decrease over time - see [Halving](./distribution#halving-mechanism)).\n    *   **How to Earn**: Primarily by running infrastructure nodes; also via specific [Activity Mining](./distribution#distribution-programs-for-hbz) programs.\n    *   **Key Uses**: \n        *   Rewarding node operators.\n        *   *Exclusive* currency for bidding on [Outer Zones](./../zone-architecture#outer-zones-released-progressively) in auctions.\n        *   Convertible to `$HBC` for spending.\n    *   **Important**: Node operation requires staking `$HBZ`. See full [Distribution Details](./distribution).\n  </Card>\n  <Card title="$HBC (Stable Currency)">\n    *   **Purpose**: Primary, stable Medium of Exchange for all transactions.\n    *   **Transferable?**: Yes (within Hubzz; external withdrawal incurs a fee).\n    *   **Supply**: Elastic (supply adjusted based on reserves to maintain peg).\n    *   **Value**: Pegged to USD (currently 64 credits = \$1).\n    *   **Key Uses**: \n        *   Buying/selling merchandise, event tickets, properties, etc.\n        *   Ensures stable and predictable pricing.\n    *   **Important**: Often, `$HBZ` earned from rewards (like Box Drops) is automatically converted to `$HBC` for user convenience. Withdrawal fees apply (see [Platform Revenue](./revenue#fiat-off-ramp)).\n  </Card>\n</Cards>
