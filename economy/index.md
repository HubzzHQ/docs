\n# Hubzz Economy Overview\n\nThis section introduces the economic principles and token system structure powering the Hubzz ecosystem.\n\n## Economic Philosophy\n\nHubzz aims to establish a robust virtual economy leveraging blockchain technology to incentivize participation, engagement, and growth. The tokenomics model rewards early adopters, stimulates economic activity, encourages event attendance, and fosters community involvement.\n\nOur economic design prioritizes:\n\n*   **Accessibility**: Lowering barriers to entry for mainstream users\n*   **Stability**: Creating predictable, sustainable value flows\n*   **Incentive Alignment**: Rewarding contributions that benefit the ecosystem\n*   **Progressive Decentralization**: Gradually shifting economic control to the community\n\n## Token System Evolution\n\nHubzz's economic model has evolved from an initial quad-token system to the current streamlined tri-token system, optimizing for both usability and economic stability:\n\n### Initial Quad-Token System\n\nThe platform was originally designed with four distinct tokens:\n\n*   `$HBE` (Equity Token): Digital representation of shareholder equity in Hubzz Inc.\n*   `$HBX` (Experience Token): Non-transferable reputation metric\n*   `$HBZ` (Node Reward Token): Infrastructure incentive token\n*   `$HBC` (Stable Currency): Primary transaction medium\n\n### Current Tri-Token System\n\nThe current model replaces the equity token with NFT-based ownership:\n\n*   **Equity NFTs**: Replace `$HBE`, providing verifiable ownership rights and dividend distribution\n*   `$HBX` (Experience Token): Retained as non-transferable reputation metric\n*   `$HBZ` (Node Reward Token): Retained as infrastructure incentive\n*   `$HBC` (Stable Currency): Retained as primary transaction medium\n\nThis evolution maintains the core functions while streamlining the economic model and embracing NFT-based ownershipâ€”a more flexible approach for equity representation and dividend distribution.
