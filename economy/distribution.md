\n# Token Distribution\n\nThis page explains how `$HBZ` tokens enter circulation and the overall allocation plan.\n\n## Distribution Programs for \$HBZ\n\nThese programs incentivize engagement and infrastructure support:\n\n*   **\$HBX Activity Tracking**:\n    *   Tracks engagement during beta; credits convert to `$HBZ` airdrop post-beta.\n    *   Rewards early adopters.\n\n*   **Randomized Box Drops (5M \$HBZ Total)**:\n    *   Claimable boxes with `$HBZ` appear in public spaces (auto-converted to `$HBC` on claim).\n    *   Number scales with public space blocks per zone.\n    *   Encourages exploration.\n\n*   **Event Mining (15M \$HBZ Total)**:\n    *   Daily `$HBZ` distributions to Zone Admins based on venue block count.\n    *   Tokens restricted to funding events/rewarding promoters (cannot be withdrawn directly by admin).\n    *   Creates a self-reinforcing cycle for active zones.\n\n## \$HBZ Token Allocation (100M Fixed Supply)\n\n*   **Public Sales**: 30M (10M private raise, 20M liquidity pool)\n*   **Activity Mining**: 20M (5M box drops, 15M event mining)\n*   **Liquidity Reserve**: 20M\n*   **Node Rewards**: 15M\n*   **Equity Shareholders**: 5M\n*   **Treasury Reserve**: 10M\n\n## Halving Mechanism\n\nTo ensure gradual circulation and long-term sustainability, `$HBZ` reward emissions (for Activity Mining and Equity Holders) halve approximately every two years. Tokens are claimable daily.\n\n**Approximate Daily Emission Schedule:**\n\n| Program              | Years 1-2 | Years 3-4 | Years 5-6 | Years 7-8 |\n| -------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |\n| Event Mining (15M)   | 20,548    | 10,274    | 5,137     | 2,568     |\n| Public Box Drops (5M)| 6,849     | 3,424     | 1,712     | 856       |\n| Equity Holders (5M)* | 6,849     | 3,424     | 1,712     | 856       |\n\n\*Equity Shareholder distribution follows a similar schedule.\n\nThis structure rewards early participants while maintaining long-term incentives.\n\n## Economic Distribution (Flow of Value)\n\nThis outlines where generated revenue/credits flow within the ecosystem:\n\n*   **Quarterly Catalog Items:** → Asset Partners or Hubzz Inc.\n*   **VIP Membership:** → Founder Zone Owners (incl.
