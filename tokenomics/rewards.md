# Engagement Rewards

Hubzz utilizes a multi-faceted rewards system to incentivize user participation, event attendance, and exploration. These rewards recognize user activity and provide tangible benefits within the ecosystem.

<Tip>Engagement rewards are designed to make participation fun and provide lasting value to active users.</Tip>

## Ticket Stubs (POAP-Inspired)

Ticket Stubs are the keystone of Hubzz engagement, serving as digital mementos for event attendance.

*   **Definition**: Digital collectibles automatically distributed to users after attending an event, inspired by POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocols).
*   **Functionality**:
    *   **Digital Keepsake**: Serve as a visual reminder and proof of attendance, containing event details (name, date, host). Displayable on user profiles.
    *   **Event History**: Users build a collectible history of their engagement across the platform.
    *   **Exclusive Merch Unlocks**: Certain stubs grant access to exclusive NFT rewards (wearables, furnishings) only available to event attendees.
    *   **Event Recording Access**: May grant access to event replays or archived content.

## Badge & Achievement System

Loyalty and consistent participation are recognized through badges.

*   **Attendance Badges**: Earn badges by attending multiple events hosted by the same group or creator, reflecting loyalty and support.
*   **Tiered Badges**: Badges can be leveled up (e.g., Bronze, Gold) based on the number of events attended, showcasing dedication.
*   **Display**: Badges can be displayed on user profiles.

## Token Earn Mechanism

Directly rewarding active participation during events.

*   **Automatic Distribution**: During select events, tokens (likely `$HBC` or convertible `$HBZ`) are distributed automatically over the event's duration.
*   **Incentive**: Encourages users to stay engaged throughout an event.
*   **Token Uses**: Earned tokens can be spent on virtual goods, tickets, or potentially traded.

## Surprise Drops

Spontaneous rewards to encourage exploration and keep the platform exciting.

*   **Random Airdrops**: Users might encounter random distributions of tokens, NFTs, or digital collectibles while exploring public zones or attending events.
*   **Incentivizing Exploration**: Drops encourage users to visit new or underutilized public areas, driving traffic and discovery.
*   **NFT & Collectible Drops**: Some drops may include limited-edition NFTs with potential marketplace value.
*   **Gamified Exploration**: May be integrated with quests or scavenger hunts.
