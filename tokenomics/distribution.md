# $HBZ Token Distribution

This page explains how the fixed supply of 100 million `$HBZ` tokens enters circulation and the overall allocation plan.

## $HBZ Token Allocation (100M Fixed Supply)

The total supply is allocated across various categories:

*   **Public Sales**: 30M (10M private raise, 20M liquidity pool)
*   **Activity Mining**: 20M (5M box drops, 15M event mining)
*   **Liquidity Reserve**: 20M
*   **Node Rewards**: 15M
*   **Equity Shareholders**: 5M
*   **Treasury Reserve**: 10M

## Distribution Programs (Activity Mining & Rewards)

These programs incentivize engagement and infrastructure support, distributing `$HBZ` into the ecosystem:

*   **Node Rewards (15M $HBZ)**: Distributed to users running infrastructure nodes, crucial for platform performance and decentralization.

*   **$HBX Activity Tracking (Part of Activity Mining Pool)**:
    *   Tracks early user engagement during beta.
    *   Beta credits converted to an `$HBZ` airdrop post-beta, rewarding early adopters.

*   **Randomized Box Drops (5M $HBZ - Activity Mining)**:
    *   Claimable boxes containing `$HBZ` appear randomly in public spaces.
    *   Claimed `$HBZ` is often **auto-converted to `$HBC`** for immediate use.
    *   The number of drops scales with the public space available in zones.
    *   Encourages exploration of the Hubzz world.

*   **Event Mining (15M $HBZ - Activity Mining)**:
    *   Daily `$HBZ` distributions directly to Zone Admins based on the venue block count in their Zone.
    *   Tokens are restricted: must be used to fund events or reward promoters/attendees within the Zone.
    *   Cannot be withdrawn directly by the Zone Admin.
    *   Creates a self-reinforcing cycle rewarding active, event-focused Zones.

<Note>
Equity Shareholder allocation (5M $HBZ) also follows the halving schedule, rewarding long-term stakeholders.

## Halving Mechanism

To ensure gradual circulation and long-term sustainability, `$HBZ` reward emissions (for Activity Mining programs and Equity Holders) halve approximately every two years. Tokens are claimable daily.

**Approximate Daily Emission Schedule:**

| Program              | Years 1-2 | Years 3-4 | Years 5-6 | Years 7-8 |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Event Mining (15M)   | 20,548    | 10,274    | 5,137     | 2,568     |
| Public Box Drops (5M)| 6,849     | 3,424     | 1,712     | 856       |
| Equity Holders (5M)* | 6,849     | 3,424     | 1,712     | 856       |

This structure rewards early participants while maintaining long-term incentives as the platform matures.
