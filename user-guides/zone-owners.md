# Guide for Zone Owners & Admins

As a Zone Owner or Admin in Hubzz, you are a virtual real estate developer and manager. You own a piece of the Hubzz world and have the tools to customize it, host events, manage properties, and generate revenue.

<Tip>
Your success depends on developing your Zone, attracting users/creators, and leveraging monetization features.
</Tip>

## Getting Started

*   **Acquire a Zone**: Purchase a [Central or Mid Zone](/virtual-world/index#zone-types) during initial sales, or potentially an [Outer Zone](/virtual-world/index#zone-types) via auction later.
*   **Bespoke Onboarding**: Utilize Hubzz's support for initial setup and strategy.
*   **Zone Admin Panel**: Familiarize yourself with the [Dashboard](/experience/dashboard#zone-admin-panel) for managing your Zone.
