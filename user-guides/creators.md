# Guide for Creators & Influencers

Hubzz is your platform to build engaged communities, host dynamic events, and monetize your content in unique ways. We provide the tools to bring your audience together in immersive virtual spaces.

<Tip>
Focus on creating compelling events, fostering community interaction, and leveraging Hubzz's monetization tools.
</Tip>

## Getting Started

*   **Form a Group**: Create a [Group](/social-layer/community) to represent your community, brand, or content focus.
*   **Explore Zones**: Consider if acquiring or renting a [Zone](/virtual-world/index) makes sense for hosting regular events or creating a dedicated community space.
*   **Customize Your Presence**: Personalize your [Avatar](/experience/avatars) to represent your brand. Consider requesting a custom avatar if applicable.
