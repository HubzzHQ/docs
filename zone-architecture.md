\nimport { Info, Note, Tab, Tabs } from 'mintlify';\n\n# Zone-Based Architecture: The Foundation of Digital Communities\n\nHubzz's virtual world is structured around a unique **zone-based architecture**. Zones are the fundamental building blocks—distinct, customizable 3D environments serving as digital headquarters for communities, brands, and creators. This system enables scalable community-building, asset ownership, and decentralized governance.\n\n<Info>\nHubzz provides fully custom, **turnkey environments**, not empty land plots. This eliminates the "ghost town" problem and ensures immediate utility and revenue potential.\n</Info>\n\n## Spatial Organization\n\n*   Zones are positioned on a **19×19 grid** (coordinates -9 to 9) using a Cartesian system.\n*   Zone (0,0) is the central Hubzz HQ.\n*   The initial 361 zones (Central and Mid) form the core world.\n*   This grid creates natural districts and neighborhoods for intuitive navigation.\n\n## Zone Categories\n\nThe Hubzz world features three primary zone types, each with different characteristics:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title="Central Zones (121 Total)">\n    *   **Location:** Core of the platform.\n    *   **Visibility:** Maximum natural traffic.\n    *   **Customization:** Highest (50,000 building blocks) for complex structures.\n    *   **Revenue:** Multiple options (property sales, events, VIP membership share).\n    *   **Governance:** 2 votes per proposal in the 361 DAO.\n    *   **Pricing:** Premium (24,000 USDC).\n    *   **Ideal For:** Large-scale events, major brand activations, core community hubs.\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title="Mid Zones (240 Total)">\n    *   **Location:** Surrounding the Central Zones.\n    *   **Visibility:** Strategic positioning, good discovery potential.\n    *   **Customization:** Moderate (40,000 building blocks).\n    *   **Revenue:** Property sales, events.\n    *   **Governance:** 1 vote per proposal in the 361 DAO.\n    *   **Pricing:** Accessible (12,000 USDC).\n    *   **Ideal For:** Established communities, growing brands, dedicated spaces.\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title="Outer Zones (Future Release)">\n    *   **Acquisition:** Via \$HBZ token auctions.\n    *   **Purpose:** Community expansion and driving decentralization.\n    *   **Customization:** Basic (30,000 building blocks), future community builder tools.\n    *   **Infrastructure:** Powered by distributed node network.\n    *   **Governance:** User-governed spaces, leading transition to full DAO management.\n    *   **Release:** Controlled by the 361 DAO, expanding outwards.\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## Landmark Zones & Special Districts\n\nCertain zones within the initial 361 are designated landmarks:\n\n*   **Commercial:** Business Center (-4,-3), Premium Outlets (3,-3)\n*   **Entertainment:** Hubzz Arena (-4,3), Gallery Square (3,3)\n*   **Residential:** Apartment Complex (-8,8), Suburban Homes (7,8)\n*   **Recreational/Utility:** Camping & Leisure (7,-7), Hubzz Landfill (-8,-7)\n*   **Central Hub:** Hubzz HQ (0,0)\n\nThese create focal points and aid navigation.\n\n## Zone Building System\n\nEach zone sits on a 64×64 grid. Structures are made using stackable building blocks:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title="Block Types">\n    *   **Event Venues (Green):** Specialized spaces for hosting events with streaming/AV modules.\n    *   **Public Areas (Purple):** Open access for community engagement; potential billboard rentals.\n    *   **Private Properties (Orange):** User-owned, sellable, customizable spaces. See [Properties](#property-distribution--management).\n    *   **Flex Spaces (Blue):** Zone-owner controlled, non-tradable spaces for exclusive/token-gated access. See [Flex Spaces](#flex-spaces).\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title="Building Constraints">\n    To ensure usability and performance:\n    *   **Block Budget Formula**: Total Blocks = Floor Tiles × Height\n    *   **Minimum Height**: 2 blocks (for avatar navigation).\n    *   **Minimum Floor Area**: 32 tiles (~8 users).\n    *   **Minimum Width**: 3 tiles between walls.\n    *   **Floor/Height Ratio**: Floor Tiles ≥ 8 × Height.\n    *   **Capacity Calculation**: 1 user per 4 floor tiles.\n    \n    <Note>Wall height affects billboard potential vs. horizontal space.</Note>\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title="Zone Capacity">\n    Approximate concurrent users per zone (avg. 3 block height):\n    *   **Central Zones**: ~4,167\n    *   **Mid Zones**: ~3,333\n    *   **Outer Zones**: ~2,500\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## Property Distribution & Management\n\nProperties are distinct units of virtual real estate within zones that can be sold to users.\n\n### Key/Location Reveal Randomizer\n\n*   **Mechanism**: Zone Admins sell property "keys"; location revealed *after* purchase.\n*   **Benefits**: Gamifies acquisition, ensures fairness, boosts secondary market value for desirable spots.\n\n### On-Chain Property Management\n\n*   **Ownership**: All properties recorded on-chain (NFTs) for transparency.\n*   **Revenue**: Admins can implement Property Owner Association (POA) fees, event revenue splits via smart contracts.\n\n### Property Types\n\nIncludes Virtual Homes, Apartments, Condos, Townhomes, Commercial Spaces.\n\n### Property Ownership Benefits\n\n*   Personalization\n*   Potential Value Appreciation\n*   Rental Income Potential\n*   Community Status Signal\n\n### Flex Spaces\n\nThese **blue** building blocks create spaces that are **different** from standard orange properties:\n\n*   **Control**: Owned *only* by the Zone Owner; cannot be traded/sold.\n*   **Use Cases**: Ideal for exclusive/token-gated areas, in-world brand stores, community showcases.\n*   **Booking**: Reserved via Hubzz event system (no ticketing needed).\n\n## Initial Zone Sale and Decentralization\n\nCentral and Mid Zones (the 361 Founder Zones) are offered first to fund development and attract key partners.\n\n*   **Goal:** Raise capital, build foundational communities.\n*   **Exclusivity:** Limited number creates value and first-mover advantage.\n*   **Zone Builder Refinement:** Construction of initial zones provides testing/feedback for the builder tools before public release.\n\n## The 361 DAO (Founders DAO)\n\nThe owners of the 361 Founder Zones form the initial governance body:\n\n*   **Structure:** Central Zones = 2 votes, Mid Zones = 1 vote.\n*   **Responsibilities:** Governs platform development, policies, economic parameters, content standards, technical upgrades, and the **release schedule for Outer Zones**.\n*   **Progressive Decentralization:** Power gradually shifts from Hubzz Inc. to the DAO and eventually the wider community/token holders. (See [Roadmap](./roadmap#progressive-decentralization))\n\n<Note>This structure provides stability while ensuring a path to community ownership.</Note>
