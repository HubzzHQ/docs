# Zone Governance & Decentralization

Hubzz follows a **progressive decentralization** approach, with governance initially concentrated in the 361 DAO (Founders DAO) before expanding to the wider community via Outer Zones and potentially an overarching DAO.

## The 361 DAO (Founders DAO)

The owners of the 361 Founder Zones (121 Central and 240 Mid Zones) form the initial governance body for the platform:

*   **Structure:** Central Zones = 2 votes/proposal, Mid Zones = 1 vote/proposal.
*   **Responsibilities:** Governs key platform aspects in the early phases, including:
    *   Platform development direction
    *   Core policies and content standards
    *   Economic parameters
    *   Technical upgrades
    *   Crucially, the **release schedule and mechanics for Outer Zones**.

<Note>This structure provides stability during the early stages while ensuring a defined path toward community ownership and broader governance.</Note>

## Initial Zone Distribution & Purpose

Central and Mid Zones (the 361 Founder Zones) are offered first via an initial sale:

*   **Goal:** Raise capital for development and attract key partners/brands/creators to build foundational communities.
*   **Exclusivity:** Limited number creates value and first-mover advantage.
*   **Zone Builder Refinement:** Construction and customization of these initial zones provide crucial testing and feedback for the builder tools before wider public release associated with Outer Zones.

## Path to Decentralization

Hubzz implements a measured, phased approach to decentralization, detailed further in the [Roadmap](/technical/roadmap#progressive-decentralization):

1.  **Centralized Foundation:** Company-led development, refining tools with Founder Zone feedback.
2.  **Hybrid Operation:** Activation of the 361 DAO, shared decision-making begins.
3.  **Full Decentralization:** Transition to broader community/token-holder governance (potentially via an overarching DAO), release of Outer Zones governed by users/DAO, open-source core, node-powered infrastructure.

<Info>
The release of Outer Zones, managed by the 361 DAO, is the key trigger for expanding governance and transitioning towards a fully decentralized, user-owned metaverse.</Info>
