# Our Virtual World

Hubzz's virtual world is built around a unique **zone-based architecture** that provides the foundation for digital communities. This section explains how our world is structured, the different types of zones available, and how properties within zones function.

<Info>
Hubzz provides fully custom, **turnkey environments**, not empty land plots. This eliminates the "ghost town" problem and ensures immediate utility and revenue potential.
</Info>

## World Map & Organization

The Hubzz world is organized on a **19Ã—19 grid** (coordinates -9 to 9) using a Cartesian coordinate system. This creates a total of 361 core zones (Founder Zones) that form the foundation of our world, with Zone (0,0) serving as the central Hubzz HQ.

This grid system creates natural districts and neighborhoods for intuitive navigation, helping users orient themselves and discover new areas of interest.

## Zone Types

Hubzz features three primary zone types, each with different characteristics and purposes:
