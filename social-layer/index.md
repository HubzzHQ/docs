# Social Layer

The Hubzz Social Layer enables rich, natural interaction between users through multiple communication channels and discovery tools, both within the immersive app engine and via the user dashboard.

Our social systems create a truly connected environment, bridging the gap between social media and immersive virtual experiences.

## Communication Channels

Hubzz offers multiple ways for users to interact with each other:

### Spatial Audio

*   **Proximity-based Voice Chat**: Hear others based on virtual distance. As you move closer, voices get louder, mimicking real-world conversations.
*   **Volume Falloff**: Conversations become quieter as you move away, just like in real life.
*   **Dynamic Channels**: Audio automatically adjusts based on your location and surroundings.
*   **Multiple Conversations**: Support for many simultaneous conversations in the same space, allowing users to naturally drift between discussion groups.

### Drop-in Audio/Video

*   **Seamless Integration**: Easy audio/video for more personal connections during events or in private spaces.
*   **Stage Mechanics**: Audience members can be invited "on stage" by hosts for real-time discussions, Q&A, or panels.
*   **Host Controls**: Full control for hosts/admins to invite or remove participants from the stage, keeping events organized.
*   **Flexible Options**: Toggle between audio-only and video modes. Video is available exclusively during events within [Venue Modules](/event-system/venues).

### Text Chat & Emotes

*   **In-World Chat**: Accessible during events, casual meetups, or zone exploration.
*   **Public and Private Messaging**: Choose between chat visible to everyone in the area or direct messages.
*   **Rich Emoji & Reactions**: Express yourself beyond words using emojis and quick reactions (e.g., via forward slash commands).
*   **Traditional Text Chat**: Comfortable option for all users, regardless of setup.
