# Community Features (Groups)

Communities, often organized as **Groups**, are at the heart of Hubzz. Groups are user-created organizations for individuals sharing common interests, goals, or activities (themes, fandoms, creators, brands, IRL events, etc.). Our platform provides tools for creating, growing, and managing vibrant communities.

<Tip>
Strong communities are the foundation of meaningful engagement and long-term platform value. Groups host events, manage content, and create engaging experiences.

## Community Creation & Management

### Group Formation
* **Easy Creation**: Simple setup process, though the number of top-level groups may be limited to maintain scarcity and encourage joining existing communities.
* **Sub-Groups / Affiliates**: Groups can form as affiliates under Zones. This allows structured growth and delegates venue/content management responsibilities to Zone owners, aiding moderation.
* **Customization**: Define visual identity, description, rules, and membership options.
* **Space Association**: Link your group to specific zones or spaces.
* **Governance Structure**: Set roles, permissions, and decision-making processes.

### Membership Management
* **Invitation Systems**: Public, invite-only, or application-based joining.
* **Role Hierarchy**: Create custom roles (Admin, Moderator) with specific permissions for moderation, event planning, etc.
* **Moderation Tools**: Member management and content moderation tools ensure guidelines are followed and experiences remain positive. Zone owners may share responsibility for sub-groups in their Zone.
* **Analytics**: Track growth, engagement, member activity, event attendance, and merch sales to make data-driven decisions (via [Dashboard](/experience/dashboard)).
