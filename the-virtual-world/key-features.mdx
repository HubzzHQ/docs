## Technical Architecture

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript API Example
// Creating an interactive object in a Hubzz zone
const myObject = hubzz.objects.create({
  type: "interactive",
  model: "cube",
  position: { x: 0, y: 1, z: 0 },
  scale: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 },
  properties: {
    clickable: true,
    material: {
      color: "#4a2afc",
      texture: "https://assets.hubzz.com/textures/metal.jpg"
    }
  }
});

// Adding interactivity to the object
myObject.on("click", (event) => {
  const user = event.user;
  
  // Change object appearance on click
  myObject.animate({
    scale: { x: 1.2, y: 1.2, z: 1.2 },
    duration: 500,
    easing: "elastic"
  });
  
  // Show a message to the user
  user.showMessage("You clicked on my object!");
  
  // Award credits for interaction
  if (!user.hasInteractedWith(myObject.id)) {
    user.awardCredits(5, "First interaction bonus");
  }
});
```

```typescript TypeScript SDK Example
import { HubzzZone, InteractiveObject, Vector3 } from '@hubzz/sdk';

// Initialize a zone
const myZone = new HubzzZone({
  id: 'my-unique-zone-id',
  name: 'My Custom Zone',
  capacity: 50,
  environment: 'cityscape'
});

// Create an interactive object with TypeScript type safety
const myObject = new InteractiveObject({
  id: 'treasure-chest',
  model: 'chest',
  position: new Vector3(0, 0, 5),
  interactionRadius: 2,
  persistent: true,
  metadata: {
    creatorId: 'user-123',
    creationDate: new Date(),
    tags: ['gameplay', 'reward']
  }
});

// Add the object to the zone
myZone.addObject(myObject);

// Define interaction behavior
myObject.onInteraction((user, interactionType) => {
  if (interactionType === 'open') {
    // Give the user a reward
    const reward = myZone.createItem('rare-token', user.id);
    user.inventory.add(reward);
    
    // Notify nearby users
    myZone.getUsers({ 
      radius: 10, 
      origin: myObject.position 
    }).forEach(nearbyUser => {
      nearbyUser.notify(`${user.displayName} found a treasure!`);
    });
  }
});
```

Hubzz employs several key technical innovations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hybrid Rendering System">
    A proprietary rendering pipeline that adapts to device capabilities, delivering optimal performance across hardware tiers. Mobile devices receive optimized assets and simplified rendering, while high-end devices benefit from enhanced visual fidelity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Progressive Loading">
    Content streamed on-demand, with prioritization based on user proximity and interaction patterns. This enables instant access with minimal initial download size, expanding as users explore.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edge Computing Integration">
    Computation distributed across cloud and edge networks to minimize latency and maximize responsiveness, particularly for real-time interactions like avatar movement and voice chat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hybrid Blockchain Architecture">
    A layered approach combining traditional databases for performance with blockchain technologies for digital ownership verification, providing the benefits of both centralized and decentralized systems.
