# Digital Ownership

Hubzz takes a balanced approach to digital assets and ownership, providing the benefits of blockchain technology without the complexity.

<Tip>
Our "Blockchain-on-the-Backend" approach ensures users get the benefits of true digital ownership without needing technical expertise.

Digital asset ownership in Hubzz is powered by blockchain technology, enabling users to:

- Own virtual items with verifiable provenance
- Transfer assets between users
- Trade assets on Hubzz marketplaces
- Potentially use assets across compatible platforms
- Retain ownership even if Hubzz were to shut down

## Economic Framework

  <Tab title="Credit System">
    Our simple-to-understand economic units make transactions intuitive:
    
    - 64 credits = $1 USD
    - Credits can be purchased with fiat currency
    - Credits are used for all in-platform transactions
    - Creators and communities receive credits from sales and events
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Revenue Streams">
    Hubzz enables multiple revenue streams for stakeholders:
    
    - **For Creators**: Event ticket sales, tips, merchandise, content subscriptions
    - **For Communities**: Membership fees, revenue shares from events, zone customizations
    - **For Zone Owners**: Property value appreciation, rental fees, activity-based rewards
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Fee Structure">
    Transparent fee structure that fairly compensates all participants:
    
    - Primary sales: 85% to creator, 15% to platform
    - Secondary sales: 70% to seller, 10% to original creator, 20% to platform
    - Event tickets: 90% to host, 10% to platform
