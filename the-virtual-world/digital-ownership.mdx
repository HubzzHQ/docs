# Digital Ownership

## Overview

Hubzz creates a balanced approach to digital ownership that combines the benefits of blockchain technology with user-friendly experiences. Our "Blockchain-on-the-Backend" approach ensures users get the benefits of true digital ownership without needing technical expertise.

## True Digital Ownership Features

Hubzz provides genuine ownership of digital assets through a hybrid approach that combines the best of centralized and decentralized systems:

### Verifiable Ownership
All digital assets in Hubzz have verifiable ownership records secured by blockchain technology, even if users don't directly interact with the blockchain.

### Transferable Assets
Users can freely trade, gift, or sell their digital assets to other users through secure transfer mechanisms. The transfer process involves:

1. Initiating the transfer by selecting the asset and recipient
2. Confirming transfer details and applicable fees
3. Verifying the transaction with security measures like 2FA
4. Completing the transfer with blockchain record updates

### Creator Royalties
Built-in royalty systems ensure original creators receive compensation for secondary sales of their work.

### Transparent Provenance
Complete ownership and transaction history for each digital asset, providing confidence in authenticity and origin:

- Creation records including creator identity, date, and specifications
- Transaction history showing ownership chain and timestamps
- Authentication mechanisms with cryptographic verification
- Fraud prevention measures
