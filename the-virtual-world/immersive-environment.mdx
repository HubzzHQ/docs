<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Activation
  // Example of object interaction
  class InteractiveObject {
    // Object responds to user proximity
    onUserApproach(user) {
      this.showInteractionPrompt(user);
    }
    
    // Object responds to user interaction
    onInteract(user, interactionType) {
      switch(interactionType) {
        case 'click':
          this.primaryAction(user);
          break;
        case 'hold':
          this.secondaryAction(user);
          break;
        // Other interaction types
