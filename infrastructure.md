It leverages **Three.js and WebGL** for optimized, cross-device performance (mobile to VR).\n*   **Social Wrapper**: Provides the user-friendly interface for all social tools (chat, friends lists, groups, profiles, feeds). It integrates seamlessly with the Game Engine but allows persistent social connections and management even outside the immersive 3D/VR environment.\n\n### Client-Side Application\n\n*   **Browser-Based Client**: WebGL application built with Three.js.\n*   **Progressive Web Application**: Native-like experience with offline capabilities.\n*   **Device Adaptation**: Dynamic rendering based on device capabilities.\n*   **Binary Protocol**: Efficient data transmission for real-time updates.\n\n### Backend Services\n\n*   **Microservices Architecture**: Modular, scalable service components.\n*   **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket connections for low-latency interaction.\n*   **Distributed Database**: Sharded database for horizontal scaling.\n*   **Content Delivery Network**: Global edge caching for static assets.\n\n### Hybrid Decentralization\n\n*   **Central Services**: Managed services for core platform functions.\n*   **Node Infrastructure**: Distributed nodes for enhanced performance and resilience.\n*   **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contracts for economic transactions and ownership.\n*   **Progressive Shift**: Gradual transition toward increased decentralization. (See [Roadmap](./roadmap#progressive-decentralization))\n\n## Scalability & Performance\n\nHubzz implements multiple strategies to ensure smooth performance at scale:\n\n### Load Management\n\n*   **Zonal Instancing**: Creating multiple instances of highly populated zones.\n*   **Dynamic LOD (Level of Detail)**: Adjusting rendering quality based on distance and importance.\n*   **Proximity Culling**: Rendering only what users can see or interact with.\n*   **Bandwidth Optimization**: Progressive asset loading and compressed data transmission.\n\n### Concurrent User Capacity\n\n*   **Zone Capacity**: Designed to support thousands of users per zone instance (e.g., >4,000 for Central Zones).\n*   **Sharding Strategy**: Creating multiple instances when zones reach capacity.\n*   **Event Scaling**: Dedicated infrastructure for high-attendance events.\n*   **Load Balancing**: Geographic distribution of processing load.\n\n### Technical Monitoring\n\n*   **Real-Time Metrics**: Continuous monitoring of performance indicators.\n*   **Predictive Scaling**: AI-based forecasting for resource allocation.\n*   **Anomaly Detection**: Automated identification of performance issues.\n*   **User Experience Tracking**: Measuring and optimizing perceived performance.\n\n## Blockchain Integration\n\nHubzz incorporates blockchain technology where it adds clear value, prioritizing user experience.\n\n<Note>\n  **Our Philosophy:** Blockchain When Beneficial. We aim to make Web3 features accessible without overwhelming users with technical complexity.\n</Note>\n\n### Blockchain Considerations\n\nSelecting the appropriate blockchain involves balancing several factors:\n*   **Scalability:** Handling a high volume of transactions efficiently.\n*   **Cost Efficiency:** Ensuring transaction fees remain low for users.\n*   **Ecosystem & Compatibility:** Leveraging existing developer tools and standards (e.g., EVM compatibility).\n*   **Sustainability:** Considering the environmental impact of the consensus mechanism.\n*   **Security & Maturity:** Relying on proven and secure infrastructure.\n\n(Various options, including EVM-compatible chains and dedicated L1 solutions like Avalanche Subnets, have been evaluated based on these criteria. The optimal choice aims to balance these factors for the platform's specific needs. See archive for detailed comparisons if interested.)\n\n### Invisible Web3\n\n*   **Custodial Wallets**: Managed wallets (e.g., via Privy.io integration) for new users.\n*   **Seamless Onboarding**: No crypto knowledge required to start.\n*   **Progressive Exposure**: Gradual introduction to blockchain concepts.\n*   **Optional Self-Custody**: Advanced users can connect their own wallets.\n\n### Asset Ownership\n\n*   **ERC-721 Compatibility**: Standard NFT implementation for digital assets like [Properties](./zone-architecture.md#property-distribution--management) and collectibles.\n*   **Verifiable Provenance**: Transparent ownership history.\n*   **Metadata Standards**: Rich, extensible metadata.\n*   **Interoperability**: Future compatibility with other platforms.\n\n### Identity System\n\n*   **Decentralized Identity**: Potential for self-sovereign identity options.\n*   **Reputation Portability**: Aiming for transferable reputation (future).\n*   **Privacy Controls**: User-managed data disclosure.\n*   **Credential Verification**: Optional real-world credential verification.
