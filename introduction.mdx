# Welcome to Hubzz

## The Metaverse That Gets It

Let's be honest—most "metaverse" platforms are confusing, empty, or just plain boring. We built Hubzz because we knew there was a better way.

Hubzz combines the best parts of social media (easy, accessible, useful) with the best parts of virtual worlds (immersive, creative, ownership-driven) without the headaches of either. The result? The first hyper-casual metaverse™ that people actually want to use.

## What Makes Us Different

* **No Downloads Required** — Access instantly from any browser, on any device
* **Multi-Speed Engagement** — Scroll like social media or dive into full 3D/VR
* **Built for Adults** — Sophisticated content, real economics, no childish gimmicks
* **Community-First** — We enhance existing communities rather than forcing you to build new ones
* **True Ownership** — Digital assets you actually own, not just rent

## How It Works

### Jump In Your Way

Hubzz meets you where you are:

* **Passive Browsing**: Scroll through content just like your favorite social network
* **Interactive 2D**: Engage through familiar interfaces while staying in 2D
* **Spatial 3D**: Step into immersive environments with your customized avatar
* **Full VR**: Connect a headset for the complete immersive experience

Switch between modes anytime—your identity, assets, and connections stay consistent.
