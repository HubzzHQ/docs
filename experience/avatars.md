# Avatar Personalization

Your avatar is your digital identity in Hubzz. Our avatar system balances rich personalization options with technical performance to ensure both expression and smooth experience across all devices. Hubzz supports both native characters with deep customization and imported characters/NFTs.

## Native Hubzz Avatars

These are characters created and fully customizable within the platform, offering the most extensive personalization options.

### Lock-In Feature (Uniqueness)

A unique feature allowing users to secure a specific avatar appearance:

*   **Claiming a Look**: Finalize a combination of apparel, accessories, and visual elements and "lock it in."
*   **Exclusivity**: While locked, *no other user* can replicate that exact combination, ensuring your avatar's appearance is unique.
*   **Presets**: Users can save multiple appearance presets, but only one can be locked at a time. Unlocking a preset makes that combination available for others.
*   **Benefit**: Helps users stand out and protects the uniqueness of their customized look.

## Imported & Custom Avatars

Hubzz also supports bringing in external avatars:

*   **Imported 3D Characters (NFTs)**: Partnerships allow users to import NFT-linked avatars (e.g., from other projects via VRM format) into Hubzz, showcasing ownership of external collectibles.
*   **Custom Avatars (Influencers/Partners)**: Specially designed, potentially more detailed avatars may be created for notable creators or partners to reflect their brand. May have exclusive features or animations.
*   **Limited Customization**: Imported avatars generally have predefined appearances based on their original design. While some compatible Hubzz accessories might be equippable, the deep customization options of native avatars are typically not available.

<Note>
See [Assets & Collectibles](/experience/assets) for details on VRM importing and standardization.
