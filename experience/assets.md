# Assets & Collectibles

Digital assets and collectibles are integral to the Hubzz experience, providing personalization, monetization opportunities, and ways to express creativity and identity.

## Asset Types

Hubzz supports a diverse range of assets:

*   **Creator Merchandise**: Custom items designed and sold by creators/groups (wearables, skins, decorations). Often branded and may be limited edition.
*   **Native Hubzz Items**: Assets designed by the Hubzz team (avatars, wearables, furniture, functional items). Released periodically via the Hubzz Catalog.
*   **Imported Items**: User-imported assets (e.g., 3D models, NFT avatars from approved collections). Requires VRM format and adherence to import guidelines. Customization might be limited compared to native assets.
*   **Asset Partner Items**: Co-branded digital goods created via partnerships with external brands (clothing, accessories, furniture). Often released as exclusive, time-limited collections.
*   **Custom Avatars**: Unique avatars potentially created for specific influencers or partners. NFT-linked avatars from external projects may also be supported.

## Asset Standardization & Importing

To ensure compatibility and performance, Hubzz uses standardization protocols:

*   **VRM Importing**: Hubzz supports importing VRM files for 3D avatars and assets, following specific guidelines. This is currently a manual review process.
*   **Verification**: Imported items undergo verification to meet platform standards (file size, optimization, compatibility).
*   **Optimization**: Assets are optimized during import to ensure fast loading and smooth performance across 2D, 3D, and VR.
*   **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Standardization ensures assets appear and function consistently across all immersion layers.

<Note>
While Hubzz aims for broad compatibility, imported assets may have limitations compared to native ones (e.g., restricted customization options).

## Digital Collectibles

Items users can collect, trade, and use for customization:

*   **Virtual Property & Rooms**: Zones and the spaces within them. Owners can decorate and customize their property with digital assets.
*   **Furniture (Furni)**: Diverse range of items (seating, tables, lighting, art, decor) for furnishing virtual properties or community zones. Some Furni may have interactive features or permission-based mechanics. Hubzz also supports "Smart Items" with embedded functionalities or smart contracts.
*   **Wearables**: Clothing, accessories, skins, backpacks, and gear for avatars. Available via Catalogue, creator merch stores, or event rewards. Includes everyday items as well as exclusive or seasonal limited-edition collectibles.
*   **Ticket Stubs**: Proof of attendance collectibles from events (see [Engagement Rewards](/tokenomics/rewards)).
*   **Badges**: Recognition for achievements and community loyalty (see [Engagement Rewards](/tokenomics/rewards)).

## Hubzz Catalogue

The platform's central marketplace for *new* digital assets and collectibles, updated quarterly.

*   **Curated Scarcity**: Quarterly releases are curated to maintain scarcity and excitement, often featuring limited-edition items available for short periods or in fixed quantities.
*   **Sneak Peeks & Previews**: Provides early previews of upcoming drops, collaborations, and partnerships (including Asset Partner items from real-world brands).
*   **Content**: Features native Hubzz items, creator merch, and Asset Partner collaborations.

## Ownership & Future-Proofing

*   **Blockchain-Backed**: Assets utilize blockchain technology for verifiable ownership, authenticity, and secure trading.
*   **Cross-Platform Vision**: Hubzz aims for future cross-platform usability and interoperability of assets where possible, increasing their long-term value.

## Monetization & Trading

*   **Player Marketplace (Secondary Market)**: Users can buy, sell, and trade collected assets (property, wearables, Furni, rare items) peer-to-peer.
*   **Listing Options**: Supports both auction and fixed-price (direct sale) models.
*   **Creator Revenue**: Creators earn from direct sales of their merchandise. Potential for royalties on secondary sales may exist.
*   **Brand Revenue**: Brands earn from sales of their Asset Partner items.
