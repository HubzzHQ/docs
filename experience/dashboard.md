# User Dashboard (Homepage)

The Hubzz User Dashboard (also referred to as the User Homepage) serves as the central hub for managing your virtual presence, assets, and activities outside the core immersive application engine. It provides a comprehensive overview and tools for various user types.

<Tip>
Think of the Dashboard as your management center, while the core app is where real-time immersion happens.
