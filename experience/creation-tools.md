# Creation Tools (Zone Builder)

Hubzz empowers creators with intuitive, **no-code** tools (collectively the Zone Builder) for building and customizing spaces within the virtual world. These tools balance creative freedom with performance guidelines to ensure great experiences.

<Note>
The initial build-out of the 361 Founder Zones serves as a crucial testing and refinement phase for these tools before a wider public release.</Note>

## No-Code Builder Interface

Our builder tools make space creation accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skill:

*   **Drag-and-Drop Design**: Intuitive placement of objects, walls, and decorative elements using [Building Blocks](/virtual-world/properties#building-system--space-types).
*   **Template Library**: Pre-designed spaces that can be customized to save time.
*   **Asset Catalog**: Extensive library of furniture, decor, lighting, functional objects, and [Venue Modules](/event-system/venues).
*   **AI Layout Assistance**: Smart suggestions for optimal space design based on purpose and capacity.

## Interactive Elements

Add dynamic elements to make spaces more engaging:

*   **Media Displays**: Embed images and videos on walls and surfaces.
*   **Interactive Objects**: Items users can click, collect, or interact with (potentially physics-based in the future).
*   **Ambient Effects**: Customize lighting, sound, and atmosphere.
*   **Triggers & Events**: Create cause-and-effect interactions within your space.

## Collaboration System

Create together with others:

*   **Multi-User Real-time Editing**: Work on the same space simultaneously with collaborators.
*   **Version Control**: Track changes and revert if needed.
*   **Testing Environment**: Preview your space before publishing.
*   **Asset Sharing Marketplace**: Exchange or sell custom-created assets with other builders.

## Space Design Guidelines & Validation

<Note>
Built-in rules ensure functional and performant spaces while still allowing creative freedom. See [Properties & Spaces](/virtual-world/properties#building-system--space-types) for specific constraints (Block Budget, Min Dimensions, Capacity Calculation, etc.).
</Note>

### Design Best Practices
*   **Navigation Flow**: Create intuitive pathways through your space.
*   **Social Zones**: Designate areas for gathering and interaction.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Guidelines for texture usage and object density.
*   **Accessibility**: Ensure spaces can be enjoyed from multiple device types and immersion levels.
