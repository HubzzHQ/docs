The Hubzz Credit system simplifies transactions while providing a stable unit of value.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Credits
  // Credit system implementation
  class CreditSystem {
    // Fixed exchange rate
    readonly CREDITS_PER_USD = 64;
    
    // Convert USD to credits
    usdToCredits(usdAmount: number): number {
      return usdAmount * this.CREDITS_PER_USD;
    }
    
    // Convert credits to USD
    creditsToUsd(credits: number): number {
      return credits / this.CREDITS_PER_USD;
    }
  }
  ```

  ```typescript Transactions
  // Example transaction
  async function purchaseTicket(event, user) {
    const ticketPriceCredits = event.ticketPriceCredits;
    
    // Check user balance
    if (user.creditBalance >= ticketPriceCredits) {
      // Deduct credits from user
      user.creditBalance -= ticketPriceCredits;
      
      // Calculate platform fee (10%)
      const platformFee = ticketPriceCredits * 0.1;
      
      // Calculate creator revenue (90%)
      const creatorRevenue = ticketPriceCredits * 0.9;
      
      // Distribute revenue
      platform.addCredits(platformFee);
      event.creator.addCredits(creatorRevenue);
      
      // Grant ticket to user
      user.tickets.push(event.generateTicket());
      
      return { success: true };
    }
    
    return { success: false, reason: "Insufficient credits" };
  }
  ```
