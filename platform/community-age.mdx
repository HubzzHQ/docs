## The Hubzz Approach to Community

Hubzz is revolutionizing digital communities by creating spaces specifically designed for adult users. Our platform acknowledges that community needs evolve as users mature, and we've built our ecosystem to address those changing requirements.

<Tip>
Hubzz doesn't try to build communities from scratch. Instead, we provide tools and spaces for existing communities to thrive in new, more engaging digital environments.
</Tip>

## Community Evolution Phases

Communities naturally progress through different phases as they grow and mature. Hubzz supports this evolution with tailored features for each stage:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Formation">
    Early community building with easy onboarding, simple engagement tools, and basic moderation capabilities. Communities at this stage benefit from Hubzz's low-friction entry points and intuitive interface.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Maturation">
    Established communities require economic sustainability and specialized features. Hubzz offers monetization paths, advanced governance systems, and integration options to help mature communities thrive.
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript Community Economy
      // Example community monetization options
      const monetizationOptions = {
        membershipTiers: [
          { name: "Basic", price: 0, features: ["Access to public spaces", "Standard participation"] },
          { name: "Supporter", price: 5, features: ["Exclusive events", "Custom badge", "Extended privileges"] },
          { name: "Premium", price: 15, features: ["Private spaces", "Priority access", "Governance rights"] }
        ],
        
        revenueStreams: [

          { type: "Space Rentals", revenueSplit: { community: 0.80, platform: 0.20 } },
          { type: "Digital Goods", revenueSplit: { community: 0.75, creator: 0.10, platform: 0.15 } }
        ],
        
        // Advanced economic tools
        economicGovernance: {
          treasuryManagement: true,
          communityVoting: true,
          revenueDistribution: true,
          grantPrograms: true
        }
      };
      ```
      
      ```typescript Governance System
      interface GovernanceSystem {
        // Role management
        roles: Role[];
        permissions: Permission[];
        
        // Decision making
        votingSystem: {
          proposalCreation: boolean;
          votingRights: VotingRight[];
          quorumRequirements: number;

        };
        
        // Moderation tools
        moderation: {

        ],
        // Additional configuration...
      };
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evolution">
    Communities eventually need to adapt or transform. Our platform provides data insights, flexible restructuring tools, and pathways to explore new models without losing existing members or content.
    
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Transformation Paths">
        Hubzz offers several well-defined paths for community evolution:
        - **Expansion**: Growing from niche to broader interest groups
        - **Federation**: Creating sub-communities with shared governance
        - **Commercialization**: Transitioning to a business or creator collective
        - **Ecosystem**: Developing a network of connected communities
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Community Health Metrics">
        Advanced analytics to guide strategic decisions:
        - Engagement depth versus breadth
        - Value creation and distribution
        - Member satisfaction and retention
        - Growth sustainability indicators

## Adult Focus: The Neglected Demographic

  <img src="/images/age-demographics.png" alt="Age demographics chart" />
