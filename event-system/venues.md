# Event Venues & Modules

Event venues are specialized spaces within Hubzz designed specifically for hosting gatherings of all kinds. These venues offer built-in **Venue Modules** and features that make events more engaging, immersive, and easy to manage, enabling experiences from concerts to conferences.

## Venue Design & Customization

*   **Flexible Design**: Hosts can customize venue layouts, including stages, seating arrangements, interactive screens, and themed decor.
*   **Event-Specific Setup**: Tailor the venue to the event type (e.g., concert stage vs. conference panel setup with breakout areas).
*   **Building Blocks**: Event Venues appear as green blocks in the Zone Building System (see [Properties & Spaces](/virtual-world/properties#building-system--space-types)).

## Venue Modules & Features

Venue Modules provide interactive capabilities:

### Multimedia & Streaming
*   **Live Streaming Integration**: Stream directly from platforms like Twitch and Kick into the Hubzz venue. Engage with the audience via chat, reactions, and drop-in audio during streams.
*   **Video Playback**: Queue and play multiple pre-recorded videos (e.g., presentations, film screenings). Supports playlists (e.g., YouTube) and potentially interactive controls like voting on the next video.
*   **Screen Sharing**: Present content from your device (slideshows, tutorials, live demos) in real-time. Supports collaborative sharing from multiple users.
*   **Webcam Support**: Presenters can use their webcams to appear on-screen, overlaying their video feed on other media for a more personal connection.

### Real-Time Interaction
*   **Drop-in Audio/Video**: Invite audience members "on stage" for live discussions, Q&A, or panels. Hosts have full moderation control (invite/remove). Drop-in *video* is exclusive to Venue Modules to maintain quality for structured events.
*   **Performance Reactions**: Audience members can use animated reactions (cheer, clap, boo, etc.) to express themselves. These reactions can optionally function as **Virtual Tips** (micro-payments) for performers/hosts.
*   **Leaderboards**: Events can feature leaderboards ranking audience members based on engagement (e.g., paid reactions/tips), adding a competitive element.
*   **Spatial Audio**: Directional sound creates natural conversation dynamics.
*   **Text Chat**: In-venue text chat for audience interaction.

### Technical Infrastructure
*   **High-Capacity Servers**: Optimized for larger concurrent user counts.
*   **Recording Capabilities**: Option to capture events for later viewing (potentially linked to [Ticket Stubs](/tokenomics/rewards)).
*   **Low-Latency A/V**: Ensures smooth real-time interaction.

## Revenue Models
