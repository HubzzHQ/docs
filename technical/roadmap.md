# Roadmap & Vision

This page outlines the planned development trajectory for Hubzz, including key phases, the approach to decentralization, future features, and the long-term vision.

## Development Timeline & Key Milestones

Hubzz's roadmap outlines key milestones across multiple phases, focusing initially on building a strong foundation and then progressively decentralizing.

<Steps>
### Foundation Phase (2023-2024)
    *   **Q4 2023**: Core platform architecture and initial prototype
    *   **Q1 2024**: Alpha release with limited zone functionality
    *   **Q2 2024**: Initial zone sales (Central & Mid Zones) and creator onboarding
    *   **Q3 2024**: Beta platform launch with Central Zone activation & refinement of Zone Builder based on feedback.
    *   **Q4 2024**: Full platform launch with complete economic system & initial Venue Module enhancements.

### Growth Phase (2025-2026)
    *   **Q1-Q2 2025**: Mid Zone activation, community expansion, implementation of Onboarding Quests & XP System.
    *   **Q3-Q4 2025**: First Outer Zone releases via DAO governance, DAO evolution, continued Venue Module enhancements.
    *   **Q1-Q2 2026**: Creator tools public release and marketplace expansion, Membership program launch (incl. Fast Pass).
    *   **Q3-Q4 2026**: Cross-platform interoperability initiatives for assets.

### Maturity Phase (2027+)
    *   **2027**: Progressive decentralization milestones, potential integration with other metaverses.
    *   **2028**: Complete transition to community governance (overarching DAO).
    *   **2029+**: Expansion beyond initial platform boundaries, autonomous growth driven by the DAO and user community.
</Steps>

<Note>
The initial sale and refinement based on the first 361 Founder Zones (Central & Mid) are crucial for testing and optimizing core features before wider release and decentralization.
</Note>

## Progressive Decentralization

Hubzz implements a measured, phased approach to decentralization:

<Steps>
### Phase 1: Centralized Foundation (2023-2025)
    *   **Company-Led Development**: Hubzz Inc. maintains control over core development and key decisions.
    *   **Initial Governance**: Company-managed decisions with community input.
    *   **Centralized Infrastructure**: Managed services for optimal UX.
    *   **Focus**: Strategic partnerships, user acquisition, refinement of core tools (Zone Builder, etc.) based on Founder Zone feedback.

### Phase 2: Hybrid Operation (2025-2027)
    *   **DAO Activation**: The [361 DAO](/virtual-world/governance) begins formal governance over specific areas (e.g., Outer Zone release schedule, policies).
    *   **Infrastructure Diversification**: Introduction of node operators.
    *   **Shared Decision Making**: Split authority between company and community.
    *   **Open Development**: Public roadmap with community contribution.

### Phase 3: Full Decentralization (2027+)
    *   **Community Governance**: Complete transition to token-holder governance via overarching DAO(s) for platform upgrades, economic changes, zone policies.
    *   **Open-Source Core**: Public repository for platform code.
    *   **Node-Powered Infrastructure**: Fully distributed processing/hosting.
    *   **Public Goods Funding**: Community treasury for ecosystem development.
    *   **Autonomous Growth**: Platform evolves based on DAO decisions and user demand, ensuring long-term sustainability.
</Steps>

## Future Features & Concepts

Beyond the core roadmap, Hubzz is exploring:

*   **Gamification**: Expanding quests, XP progression, leaderboards, and gamified exploration.
*   **Membership Benefits**: Implementing features like the "Fast Pass" for priority event access.
*   **Tile-Based Capacity**: Refining space capacity limits based on tile count to manage server load and user experience.
*   **AI-Driven Discovery**: Using AI for smarter recommendations (friends, events, groups) and potentially personalized content generation.

## Long-Term Vision

<Info>
Hubzz's ambition is to create a sustainable, self-governing digital ecosystem designed to last for decades, impacting digital citizenship, the spatial internet, and online culture.
</Info>

### Digital Citizenship
*   **Community-Based Governance**: Self-governing digital communities with real authority.
*   **Digital Rights Framework**: Established standards for rights in virtual spaces.
*   **Cross-Platform Identity**: Portable digital identity across the internet.
*   **Stakeholder Capitalism**: Economic systems where users share in platform success.

### Spatial Internet
*   **3D Information Architecture**: Reimagining information organization spatially.
*   **Physical/Digital Convergence**: Seamless transitions between real and virtual.
*   **Ambient Computing Integration**: Connections with IoT.
*   **Spatial Productivity**: New paradigms for work and collaboration.

### Cultural Impact
*   **Digital Anthropology**: New forms of culture emerging.
*   **Creative Renaissance**: Expanded channels for artistic expression.
*   **Global Accessibility**: Breaking geographic/economic barriers.
*   **Human Connection**: Technology serving meaningful relationships.
