Hubzz's unit economics improve significantly with user engagement level and tenure:

| User Segment | Monthly ARPU | Annual Value | LTV (3-Year) | Acquisition Cost |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Casual User | $0.50-$1.00 | $6-$12 | $15-$25 | $2-$3 |
| Active User | $3.00-$5.00 | $36-$60 | $90-$150 | $5-$8 |
